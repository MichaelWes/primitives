# primitives

This is supposed to be practice implementing cryptographic primitives and testing functionality in bash.

Why would you do this? Just to force yourself to use bash syntax and explore the existence of BATS testing machinery, mainly.

There are many reasons you shouldn't use this or implement this way for real scenarios.
